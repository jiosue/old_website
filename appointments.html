                                I studied proton vs neutron dynamics in asymmetric nuclei and short range deuteron clustering in nuclei. We worked in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator in Virginia, using data collected there for our analysis. I worked alongside a graduate student and perform data analysis using C++ and ROOT. This includes particle identification and various detector specific work such as acceptance and fiducial analysis for 3He and 4He(e,e’p) and (e,e’d) reactions. Our goal was to filter out inelastic reaction channels so as to compare quasielastic collisions with theoretical models.

                                Worked alongside a postdoc to model short and long range interacting fermionic spin chains and Kitaev wires, focusing on how magnetic field and interaction strength parameters affect the steady state of the system. We studied the relationship between dynamical and quantum phase transitions via quench dynamics in integrable and nearly-integrable systems. Our paper is on PRL and arXiv (see <a href="#Publications">Publications</a>).
