                    <em>Abstract:</em> Trotterization-based, iterative approaches to quantum simulation are restricted to simulation times less than the coherence time of the quantum computer, which limits their utility in the near term. Here, we present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF), for decreasing the quantum circuit depth of quantum simulations. VFF seeks an approximate diagonalization of a short-time simulation to enable longer-time simulations using a constant number of gates. Our error analysis provides two results: (1) the simulation error of VFF scales at worst linearly in the fast-forwarded simulation time, and (2) our cost function's operational meaning as an upper bound on average-case simulation error provides a natural termination condition for VFF. We implement VFF for the Hubbard, Ising, and Heisenberg models on a simulator. Finally, we implement VFF on Rigetti's quantum computer to show simulation beyond the coherence time.

                    <em>Abstract:</em> The study of quantum phase transitions requires the preparation of a many-body system near its ground state, a challenging task for many experimental systems. The measurement of quench dynamics, on the other hand, is now a routine practice in most cold atom platforms. Here we show that quintessential ingredients of quantum phase transitions can be probed directly with quench dynamics in integrable and nearly integrable systems. As a paradigmatic example, we study global quench dynamics in a transverse-field Ising model with either short-range or long-range interactions. When the model is integrable, we discover a new dynamical critical point with a nonanalytic signature in the short-range correlators. The location of the dynamical critical point matches that of the quantum critical point and can be identified using a finite-time scaling method. We extend this scaling picture to systems near integrability and demonstrate the continued existence of a dynamical critical point detectable at prethermal timescales. We quantify the difference in the locations of the dynamical and quantum critical points away from (but near) integrability. Thus, we demonstrate that this method can be used to approximately locate the quantum critical point near integrability. The scaling method is also relevant to experiments with finite time and system size, and our predictions are testable in near-term experiments with trapped ions and Rydberg atoms.

                    <em>Abstract:</em> The optimization of circuit parameters of variational quantum algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a key challenge for the practical deployment of near-term quantum computing algorithms. Here, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization procedure inspired by the Jacobi diagonalization algorithm for classical eigendecomposition, and combined with Anderson acceleration. In the first stage, analytical tomography fittings are performed for a local cluster of circuit parameters via sampling of the observable objective function at quadrature points in the circuit angles. Classical optimization is used to determine the optimal circuit parameters within the cluster, with the other circuit parameters frozen. Different clusters of circuit parameters are then optimized in "sweeps,'' leading to a monotonically-convergent fixed-point procedure. In the second stage, the iterative history of the fixed-point Jacobi procedure is used to accelerate the convergence by applying Anderson acceleration/Pulay's direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS). This Jacobi+Anderson method is numerically tested using a quantum circuit simulator (without noise) for a representative test case from the multistate, contracted variant of the variational quantum eigensolver (MC-VQE), and is found to be competitive with and often faster than Powell's method and L-BFGS.

                    <em>Abstract:</em> We present an optimization procedure for a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) which combines outer-loop methods from Zhou et al (2018) with a routine which is a bounded variant of a modified Powell minimization procedure. We find that our technique outperforms other tested methods, and in particular is independent of the choice of the initial angles used to begin the optimization for all tested instances. Because the performance of future iterations has minimal dependence on current angles, we conjecture that our method will maintain its advantage over other methods in the presence of noise, under the intuition that noise acts as perturbations to the angles, and we have found that slightly varying the current point does not significantly affect our method. We test our method and others with various quadratic Hamiltonians, including fully-connected Max-cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising problems. We perform preliminary study on extentions to our method based on observations of general tendencies of the optimal variational parameters, and show that they often converge in fewer observable measurements. Our method provides a simple way to significantly improve the performance of a QAOA on near-term quantum processors, allowing for faster convergence with minimal overhead.
